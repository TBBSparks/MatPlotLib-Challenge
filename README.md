# MatPlotLib-Challenge

Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API (Application Programming Interface) for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+.  

In my exploration of languages and applications, this has by far been my favorite thing to learn about.  Not necessarily the easiest, but definitely my favorite!
